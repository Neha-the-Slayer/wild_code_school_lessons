    <h1>A list of essential git commands</h1>
    <section>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>git add .</strong>: Add to staging what will be committed excluding deletions</li>
        <li><strong>git diff </strong>: difference between working directory and staging. Use flag <strong>--staged(or cached)</strong> to get differences in the staging area</li>
        <li><strong>git reset HEAD < filename ></filename> </strong>: remove from staging. Just "<strong>git reset</strong>" to remove all form staging</li>
        <li><strong>git commit -m</strong>: Commit a version to git. The "-m" allows you to specify a message to add info about the commit</li>
        <li><strong>git checkout < filename ></strong>: Discard changes in working directory</li>
        <li><strong>git checkout  < branch ></strong>: Switch to a different branch</li>
        <li><strong>git checkout -b < new branch name > < Log Code ></strong>: When checked out in a previews Log, create a new branch</li>
        <li><strong>git checkout -b < new branch name > origin < Existing Branch Name ></Log></strong>: When Pulling somone elses repo, it  will only pull master. Issue the command to pull a specific branch name in a new branch</li>
        <li><strong>git merge < branch ></strong>: merge < branch > in the branch you are currently in</li>
        <li><strong>git branch</strong>: Show all branches available</li>
        <li><strong>git branch < name ></strong>: Create a new branch. This is like saving the state of everything at a given point</li>
        <li><strong>git branch -m < original name> < new name ></strong>: to change the name of a branch</li>
        <li><strong>git branch -D < branch name ></strong>: To delete  a branch</li>
        <li><strong>git rm < /filename ></strong>: delete a file and automatically moves it to the staging environment ready to be committed</li>
        <li><strong>git rm --cached < /filename ></strong>: To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked</li>
        <li><strong>git mv < /filename ></strong>: rename a file and automatically moves it to the staging environment ready to be committed</li>
        <li><strong>git clone < repository URL ></strong>: Copy a git repository on you local machine. Will only pull the master branch</li>
        <li><strong>git clone -b < branch name > < repository URL ></strong>: Copy a specific branch from a git repository on you local machine</li>
        <li><strong>git log</strong>: A list of all commit made for the project</li>
        <li><strong>git push</strong>: After committing, push the changes to the remote repo</li>
        <li><strong>git push --set-upstream origin < branch Name ></branch></strong>: After creating a branch and after committing, push the changes and the new branch to the remote repo</li>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <h3>git add commands</h3>

    <h3>Clone a full repository with all branches</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>git clone --mirror < repository URL ><span style="color:red">.git</span></strong>: Copy a git repository on you local machine including all Branches.</li>
      <li>The command above will copy the invisible <strong>.git</strong> folder that keeps track of everything that happens in a repository.</li>
      <li>Next run, <strong>git config --bool core.bare false</strong>: This will modify a boolean value that will take the repo from being a bare repository into a regular one</li>
      <li>Next run, <strong>git reset --Hard</strong>: This is a hard reset that will take everything that is inside the <strong>.git</strong> and create all the branches makeing it look like normal repository</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Git Log Flags</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>git log -n < number ></strong>: List of the last n commits</li>
      <li><strong>git log --since=< yyy-mm-dd ></strong>: Will return the commit since a certain date.</li>
      <li><strong>git log --until=< yyy-mm-dd ></strong>: Will return the commit untill a certain date. It can be used together with since</li>
      <li><strong>git log --author=< any part of a name ></strong>: Will return the commits from authors whose name matched the string</li>
      <li><strong>git log --author=< any part of a name ></strong>: Will return the commits from authors whose name matched the string</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Commit Messages best practices</h3>

    <h3>Git Concpts and architecture</h3>
    <h4>Hash Values (SHA-1)</h4>
    <p>git keeps track of change sets. For each of them it generates a checksum (or hash values). This is generated by taking data and feeding it to a mathematical alogrithm (SHA-1) which converts the data into a number. This number is called checksum: The same data, put in the same algorithm, always return the same result (checksum). This guarantee data integrity. The checksum is a 40 character hexadecimal string(0-9,a-f).</p>
    <h4>The HEAD pointer</h4>
    <p>The HEAD pointer is a reference variable that points to a specific commit in the repository: The parent of the next commit that we'll make (or The Tip of the current branch in the repository).</p>
    <h4>git workflow - A Graphical representation</h4>
    <img src=".\img\git_workflow.PNG" alt="git_workflow">
    <h3>git push -u origin</h3>
    <p>The -u option is important because it binds your local branch to the remote branch. origin is the name of the remote which we gave to it when we ran git remote add. master is the name of the branch created on the remote, the same as your current local branch. Note: the -u option is to be used only during your first push of this branch. After entering the command, your local and remote master branches are linked. With the future pushes from your local master branch, Git will know that it must push to the remote master branch.</p>
    <p>It is possible to use the push in several ways depending on the arguments, but at the moment, just remember that we specify the remote and the branch the first time with the <strong>-u</strong> flag, and that thereafter, git push is enough</p>
